        <!--product info-->
        <h2>Our product answers problems that many people who wear masks have to deal with every day. The smart mask utilizes an H11 Hepa Filter and a carbon filter for both ventilation holes. These filters remove particles as small as 0.03 microns, leading to an effective solution to filter around 95% of viruses. While also removing almost all of the VOCs in the air, this mask ensures a safe experience for the user. Other features that this product offers are a dual microphone array built around the mouth area for answering phone calls without background noise, the IP68 waterproof covering on mask, and it having two speakers on each side of the mask next that act as headphones. This mask will connect to a phone with bluetooth so listen to music.<br> 

            Our mask is made of many components. The frame is a flexible 3D printed piece made to conform to our user’s face. The rest of the mask is a silicone material prioritizing comfort to reduce irritation. The flexible 3D frame along with the silicone mode makes it easy to disinfect. The mask will include a system-on-chip(SOC) which houses the cpu, ram, storage, and power management controller of our device. This would connect to the battery, the I/O which is just a sole USB-C port, the wifi/bluetooth antennas, the GPS antenna, a HEPA/Carbon filter sensor to know if the filters need to be cleaned, and the dual-array microphone setup and the the stereo speakers.
